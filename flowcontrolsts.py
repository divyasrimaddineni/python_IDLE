#Flow-Control Statements:

Every python statement executes only once from top to bottom.
In order to execute or not to execute set of sts, we go for Flow-Conttrol sts
                     #or
To execute set of sts for repeated no.of times, we go for "control structures" or "loops".

#Flow-control sts are divided into 2 parts:
1.Condition: An expression which returns a boolean value.

2.Block/clause: Set of sts following the same space indentation.

#Various Flow-Control Sts or loops are:
1.if
2.if-else
3.elif
4.for-->most widely used and powerful in python.
5.while
6.while-else
7.break
8.continue
9.pass
