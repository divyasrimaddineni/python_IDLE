#Collection datatypes: 4types
1.list------->[]
2.tuple------>()
3.set-------->{}
4.dictioary-->{k:v}

#1.List: List is a collection datatype which holds group of values

#list properties:
1.List is represented using []

2.List supports both homogeneous(similar elements or values) and
  heterogenous elements(dissimilar elements)
Ex:x=[10,20,30,40] #homogeneous elements
   y=[101,"divya",4089.876] #heterogenous elements
   
3.List allows duplicate elements
Ex: x=[10,20,30,40,10,20,50,30,50]

4.In list,insertion order is preserved i.e., the order in which the
elements are inserted and in the same order they are stored or displayed.

5.List supports 2 types of indexes
  1.positive index or forward index--->starts from left to right
                                   --->index starts with 0
  2.Negative index or backward index--->starts from right to left
                                    --->index starts with -1
                                    
       0  1  2  3  4----->positive index or forward index
Ex: x=[10,20,30,40,50]
       -5 -4 -3 -2 -1---->Negative index or backward index

6.List is a mutable object i.e.,changes or modifications are allowed
within a list but elements of a list can be mutable or immutable.
x=[10,20,30,40,50,[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]--->#No.of elements are 7
